                <b>Hypothesis</b><br>
                By mapping and analyzing the material composition of New York City’s buildings, we can reveal patterns of urban transformation that inform better decisions for preservation, demolition, and future construction.
                <br><br>
                <b>Project Description</b><br>
                Urban Vein is a web-based platform that uses the material composition of New York City's buildings to uncover urban transformation patterns. The project investigates how materials define a city's identity over time and aims to help spatial decision-makers identify trends that impact urban development. Through visualizing material data, it reveals what is being lost, what exists, and what could shape future construction.<br>
                At stake is the sustainability of urban environments and the need for responsible decision-making in the face of ongoing demolition and reconstruction. The platform works across multiple scales, from individual buildings to city-wide distributions, and dimensions—both spatially and temporally. The data visualization and mapping methods allow for interaction with NYC’s built environment, giving users an insightful look into its ongoing evolution.
                <br><br>
                <b>Computational Methods</b><br>
                Urban Vein uses open data from NYC, applying machine learning models to estimate the material compositions of buildings. These models identify material archetypes for roughly 10% of the city's buildings, and infer materials for the remaining majority based on building age, size, and usage. D3.js is then used to create a dynamic map visualization, which overlays five distinct material layers through a chromatic aberration visualization technique.<br>
                This computational approach allows for large-scale data analysis and real-time user interaction, providing a clear understanding of the material patterns shaping urban landscapes. The workflow enables the platform to handle complex spatial data, providing users with insightful and visually appealing representations of NYC's urban material distribution.
                <br><br>
                <b>Design Methods</b><br>
                Urban Vein employs analytic and narrative design methods. The platform is both experimental and speculative, using material data to tell stories about the past, present, and future of urban environments. It provides a space for participatory interaction where users can engage with visualized urban material data through toggles, hover functions, and comparison tools.<br>
                The platform’s design empowers users to make informed decisions about sustainable building practices and city planning. It critiques conventional practices around urban demolition and preservation, offering a new way to consider building materials through a lens of environmental stewardship and urban transformation. By engaging users in speculative narratives, Urban Vein transforms dry data into compelling, actionable insights.
                <br><br>
                <b>Precedents</b><br>
                Urban Vein builds upon the work of several key precedents in data-driven urban mapping and sustainability. Projects like Mapping Historical New York and the Climate-Conflict-Vulnerability Index have influenced the way Urban Vein approaches mapping and visualization. These projects highlight the power of geospatial analysis to inform urban planning and design. Additionally, research into material footprints such as City-Scale Assessment of the Material and Environmental Footprint of Buildings provides a foundation for the material estimation methods used in Urban Vein. This project critiques the present condition of urban development by proposing a new lens: one that centers material distribution as a crucial factor in shaping cities.<br>
                Urban Vein also integrates commercial products like RSMeans Data, Circularise, and Zillow to enhance material estimation and provide a more comprehensive view of urban environments. These tools ensure that the material estimation process is both data-rich and reflective of real-world economic and environmental factors.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://halfward.github.io/UrbanVein/"><b>Proof of Concept</b></a><br>
                The proof of concept for Urban Vein includes the initial prototype of the interactive map and data layers, where users can toggle between material types and view the composition of different NYC neighborhoods. The data visualization prototype uses D3.js to display the materials in vibrant, layered colors, with hover functions providing detailed information about building materials, age, and usage.<br>
                Upcoming iterations will include timeline features to simulate changes over time and further enhancements to interactivity, such as more intuitive comparison panels for building archetypes and material composition. Also, the main focus for the final semester (2025 spring) will be creating scrollytelling experiences using Urban Vein's platform structure. These stories will explore past, present, and future urban possibilities, all through the building material lens. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Audience</b><br>
                Urban Vein is aimed primarily at urban planners, architects, and sustainability advocates who seek to make informed decisions about urban development and materials. The platform's accessibility is key, and it can be used by a broad range of users interested in the future of cities.<br>
                The platform could also be adapted for educational purposes, offering students and researchers a tool for understanding urban transformation.
                <br><br>
                <b>Data</b><br>
                The project uses several datasets, including NYC building footprints, zoning features, subway lines, and open data on building demolition. The base maps mianly come from NYC's PLUTO data and other public geospatial sources.<br>
                The data is already accessible and continuously updated through open-source platforms, ensuring that Urban Vein remains an up-to-date and reliable tool for urban analysis.
