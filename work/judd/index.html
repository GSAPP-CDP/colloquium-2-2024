                <h3>Locating trust and novel forms of sharing.</h3>
                <p>
                    Unique combinations of sensors, hardware, and synthetic rulesets govern our Western world. We
                    believe
                    by developing novel mobile hardware that scaffolds localized trust by reducing interactional
                    affordances
                    and introducing physical-digital sharing protocols, we can support a more relationally connected
                    future.

                <p>
                    We are developing a novel navigation and social networking experience that fosters trusted
                    real-world interactions through generating contextual itineraries from aggregating your
                    peers’ location-recommendations with your personal context and location intelligence to
                    reduce screen dependency and build relational trust and intersubjectivity within communities
                    through shared experiences.

                <p>
                    Stephen Levinson’s work on the Human Interaction Engine attributes three properties of Human
                    social interaction: The attribution of intention through behavior mapping onto goals, mutual
                    salience or common ground—necessary for cooperative interaction, and intentions that drive
                    behavior solely effected by virtue. Because technology and tools become an extension of our
                    cognition, it is important to explore and create new configurations of sensors and rulesets
                    to afford a different texture of presence that preserves the elements of our human
                    sociality. This is a socially oriented practice, which aims to create new social structures
                    and scaffolding for more authentic relations than incumbent digital systems do.

                    There have been a number of precedents, either full reduced affordance provocations or companion

                        This way, what is lost on screen might be added in-person.

                        Current online network communities take many different approaches at organizing their
                        communities. We propose teasing out and visualizing a user's network by exposing their timezone
                        (awake, sleeping), updates on where they’ve been place-wise recently, and visualizing who’s
                        connected to who.

                    According to the Carson College of Business’ 2024 American Travel Survey, over a third of Gen Z
                    (38%)
                    and
                    Millennials (34%) expect to spend “a lot of time” comparing costs of travel destinations and
                    activities.
                    These generations rely heavily on technology for planning and prioritize authenticity and
                    sustainability.
