            <em>Resistant Temporalities</em> is a <em>critical computation project</em>
            that rethinks how
            we experience time and space.
        </div>
        <div class="line"> it is a body of work - an atlas of research, writings, artwork, and digital tools.
        </div>

        <div class="line">Over centuries, standardized systems — <em>clocks</em>, <em>calendars</em>,
            and <em>satellite maps</em> — have transformed time into a <em>rigid construct</em>, and space into
            <em>flat abstractions</em>.
        </div>
        <div class="line">These tools claim to organize our lives but isolate us from the <em>natural systems</em> that
            once guided human understanding.</div>
        <div class="line">What if we reclaimed time — not as dictated, linear units — but as something shaped through
            our observation with the <em>sun</em>, <em>moon</em>, <em>stars</em>, and
            <em>clouds</em>?
        </div>
        <div class="line"><em>Historically, time was dynamic, open-source, and rooted in observation.</em></div>
        <div class="line">The stars moved <em>15 degrees an hour</em>, the moon marked the month through its
            phases, and the sun’s path defined location and seasons.</div>
        <div class="line">These systems have not changed, but our <em>awareness</em> of them has.</div>
        <div class="line">We’ve been coddled by tools that reduce diverse temporal and spatial experiences into a
            <em>single construct</em>.
        </div>
        <div class="line">These constructs are not neutral—they are deeply political, deeply imperial, and erase
            alternative ways of knowing while disempowering individuals from having temporal and spatial autonomy.</div>
        <div class="line"><em>What if computation amplified rather than replaced knowledge?</em></div>
        <div class="line"><em>What if technology extended human experience rather than muting it?</em></div>
        <div class="line">This project proposes alternatives through a <em>resistant atlas</em> of four maps
            layering solar, meteorological, and celestial data within a computational framework.</div>
        <div class="line">At their core are <em>imaginaries preserved through language</em>—especially in the nomadic
            life of Arab Bedouins and other civilizations in open landscapes like deserts or the Arctic, where they
            could only <em>look up</em>.</div>
        <div class="line">By returning to environmental observation and culturally embedded knowledge systems, we can
            begin to rehabilitate sovereignty over time and space.</div>
        <div class="line">This work critiques computation by using its own tools—<em>parametric modeling</em>,
            <em>mathematical graphing</em>, <em>machine learning</em>, and <em>image detection</em>—to challenge its
            limits while proposing new ways to record and interpret temporal and spatial data.
        </div>
        <div class="line">It’s an experiment in reclaiming agency and reframing technology as an appreciative
            collaborator, not a dictator.</div>
