    <meta name="description" content=" This project examines the accessibility and equity of delivery services across urban and suburban regions in the United States, with a particular focus on their human-centered implications. Despite the ubiquity of delivery services in modern life, significant inequities remain, especially in <strong>underserved areas</strong> and <strong>among economically disadvantaged populations</strong>. The research highlights systemic challenges, including delivery deserts, prohibitive costs, and situational barriers faced by individuals with mobility limitations, disabilities, or inflexible work schedules. To address these disparities, the project proposes augmenting existing systems with human-centered interventions, such as shared delivery networks and customizable delivery schedules, to promote inclusivity and equitable access for all.">
